			Sometimes, a web page may needto provide a message to assistive 
			technologies that an event happened. For example, if a data table
			was resorted based on a column, a screen reader should be informed 
			the table was successfully resorted. In general, any dynamic action
			that shows visual evidence may need to provide confirmation.
			
			The Screen Reader Messaging (SRM) library provides a straightforward 
			means of passing a message to screen readers and other assistive 
			technologies via a visually hidden live region using the two ARIA
			attributes <code class="language-html">aria-live</code> and 
			<code class="language-html">aria-atomic</code>.

			</a>
		</div>
		<p>
			The SRM library is designed for easy, straightforward deployment. 
			One needs to only include the small script file:
		</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="dist/sr-messaging.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>
			Whenever a message needs to be sent to a screen reader, just grab
			the SRM messenger object and use the <code>say()</code> method to
			deliver the message:
		</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let srm = ScreenReaderMessenger.getMessenger();
srm.say('Hello World!');</code></pre>
		
		<p>
			The SRM library uses the 
			<a href="https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/singleton">singleton
			pattern</a>, meaning there is only screen reader messaging service available at
			any time. Each time you call getMessenger(), you will receive the same SRM
			object. 
		</p>

				Demonstration
			</h3>
			<a href="#demo">
				<svg><use xlink:href="#icon-link"></use></svg>
				<span>Basic Usage Anchor Link</span>
			</a>
		</div>
		<p> 
			The following demonstrates the screen reader messaging utility. 
			Clicking the button returns the current seconds in the current
			time. This message is conveyed in three ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The message "Seconds are #" is conveyed via the SRM to any
				active screen readers.
			</li>
			<li>The same message is logged in the textbox for debugging 
				purposes.
			</li>
			<li>The same message is also logged to the console in the 
				browser's developer tools.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div id="example">
			<button id="speak-trigger">Say current seconds</button>
			<textarea id="debug-log" rows="2" cols="25"></textarea>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			The overall code for implementing the example is straightforward.
			More lines were needed to implement the timestamp formatting for 
			the debug log! If the debugging feedback was not included, the 
			code could be simplified to the following vanilla HTML 
			and JavaScript:
		</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;
	...
	&lt;script src="dist/sr-messaging.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	...
	&lt;script&gt;
		window.onload = function() {
			document.getElementById('speak-trigger').addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
				let d = new Date();
				ScreenReaderMessenger.getMessenger().say('Seconds are ' + d.getSeconds();
			});
		}
	&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>

		<p>
			Note how you can chain the getMessenger() and say() methods if 
			so desired.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Additional Usage Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This library should only be used for informing of minor events
				to screen readers, such as a table being resorted or multiple
				disclosure panels being opened or closed en masse. It is NOT
				for reporting critical events such as alerts.
			</li>
			<li>As a rule of thumb, no messaging is necessary for interactions
				that leave some evidence of happening. For example, opening or
				closing a disclosure that sets <code>aria-expanded</code> does
				not need additional messaging. 
			</li>
			<li>Any and all messages should be short and concise so that
				they can be read within a window of time. The default duration
				for this window is 5 seconds.
			</li>
			<li>Do not send too many messages. If multiple messages are triggered
				at the same time, they will interfere and overwrite each other. 
				This was a deliberate design choice to deter spamming screen
				reader users.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The SRM library functions through the coordination of a DIV
			that is an ARIA live region and the ScreenReaderMessenger 
			object that coordinates updating and timing of the message.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Creating an ARIA Live Region</h3>
		<p>
			Once the page is loaded, the SRM appends a DIV element to the
			DOM. This DIV element will temporarily contain the text of the
			messages. Importantly, this DIV is styled so that it is shown
			to only screen reader users. If the DIV was hidden using techniques
			like <code class="language-css">display:none</code>, messaging
			would not work. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This DIV's "invisible" styling is similar to other common
			<a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/">CSS 
			for invisible content for screen reader users</a>. As it is
			positioned absolutely, it should not impact the layout of any
			site. The CSS also has extensive (and arguably necessary) usage
			of the <code>!important</code> property to
			greatly reduce any styles undoing the invisibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			The DIV is also an 
			<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA
			live region</a>. Through the combined used of the ARIA attributes 
			<code class="language-html">aria-live="polite"</code> and 
			<code class="language-html">aria-atomic="true"</code>, the browser 
			will inform screen readers of any non-empty updates to the DIV's 
			text. Note that this live region is <em>polite</em> in that
			the message will not interrupt any other messages from the screen 
			reader. The live region is also not given an ARIA role as none of
			the currently available roles are appropriate. This messaging library
			should NOT be used for critical announcements that would fall under a
			<code class="language-html">role="alert"</code> situation.
		</p>
		
		<h3>The ScreenReaderMessenger Object</h3>
		<p>
			Just creating a live region is not enough to provide dynamic 
			messaging to screen readers. The ARIA live region we created
			only announces additions to the text content but NOT any 
			deletions. This works to our advantage. When the <code>say()</code>
			method is called, the DIV's text content is initially reset to
			the empty string. This does not get announced because it is 
			not an addition to the text. Then, the message is placed in
			the DIV. This triggers the live region to inform the screen
			reader of the new content. This also means that the same
			text message can be communiciated multiple times as the 
			reset then update process always triggers an addition.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, there is a problem with this approach. Because the
			DIV's content is not hidden to everyone, that text may be found
			inconveniently through actions such as selecting all the text
			or using a browser's find in page features. Thus, it is prudent
			to always erase the DIV's text content eventually. The timing of 
			this is tricky, though. Some screen readers will
			cease reading the text if it is deleted while being outputted.
			Thus, you need to delay the erasing using a call to the 
			<code>setTimeout</code> method in JavaScript. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The SRM handles this delayed erasing as well as making sure
			no erroneous timeouts accidentally erase the text while it
			is being read out loud. The internal variable 
			<code>ERASE_DELAY</code> defines the delay, currently set to
			5000 milliseconds (5 seconds). This delay mostly suffices
			assuming that any message is concise enough. However, if 
			the screen reader's speech rate is set too slow, messages
			may be cut off. If users report this is a problem, increase
			the erase delay.
